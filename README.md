Recent web UI frameworks give addon developers the opportunity to
design fantastic pages for their addons. This community module makes
it easier to create great addon pages such as complex settings pages
requiring computation and interactivity with a unique user experience
and design.

This module does only a few things:

    - Like the core addon-page module, it hides the location bar. But
      instead of being limited to a single page in your data/
      directory, you can create a new tab for any URL (including local
      addon pages) with a hidden location bar.
      
    - To increase the distinct flavor of your addon, you can
      also add CSS styles to the tab itself of your addon tab. You may
      give it a certain background color, change the aspect of the
      label, or add a background-image...
      
    - It uses the tabs module, allowing you to inject content scripts
      and communicate with your addon scripts.
      
Use it with a great framework such as Bootstrap or jQuery UI and
create awesome pages!
